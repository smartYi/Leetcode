# Leetcode
This repository includes all the solutions for the Leetcode algorithm part. For each problem, I give out the basic interpretation and idea to solve this problem.

I separate different folders based on their tags and you can find your wanted problem easily once you get its tag. The tags include:

- **Array**
- **Hash Table**
- **Linked List**
- **Math**
- **Two pointers**
- **String**
- **Binary search**
- **Divide and conqure**
