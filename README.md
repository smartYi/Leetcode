# Leetcode
This repository includes all the solutions for the Leetcode algorithm part. For each problem, I give out the basic interpretation and idea to solve this problem. I am not sure that these solutions are the optimal but just some references for your further thinking. I separate different folders based on their tags and you can find your wanted problem easily once you get its tag. The tags include:
